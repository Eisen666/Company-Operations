title: Example Markdown Document
---

Hello! Welcome to this example Markdown documentation for Docusaurus!

## Front Matter

At the top of your markdown document, you may include metadata called
[Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). For example:

```plaintext title="example-doc.md"
// highlight-start
---
id: my-doc-id
title: Example Document
description: A document description
slug: /custom-url
---
// highlight-end

## Markdown heading

Markdown text with [links](./hello.md)
```

## Headings

Headings are creating using the # character to identify heading levels.

```md

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

```

This creates:

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

Headings also allow for easy direct linking to certain parts of a document, with 'Heading 6' for
example allowing you to specify `www.mysite.com/docs/this-document` to
`www.mysite.com/docs/this-document#heading-6`.

## Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

If the current document is located in `mysite/docs/exampledocs/fun-document.md` these examples would
link to the document `example-doc.md` within:

`mysite/docs/example-doc.md`

```md
Find out more at [Example document](/example-doc.md).
```

`mysite/docs/exampledocs/example-doc.md`

```md
Find out more at [Example document](./example-doc.md).
```

Of course, you can also simple use a URL path instead of a relative file path:

```md
Find out more at [Example document](www.mysite.com/docs/example-doc)
```

## Lists

Lists can be ordered or unordered depending on the bullet point used:

```md
- Eggs
- Bacon
- Cheese
```

This produces an unordered list.

- Eggs
- Bacon
- Cheese

```md
1. Fry the egg.
2. Add bacon.
3. Shred cheese.
```

This produces an ordered list.

1. Fry the egg.
2. Add bacon.
3. Shred cheese.

Lists can also be nested.

```md
- Testing
  1. Begin testing.
  2. Finish testing.
- Serving
  - Always serve properly.
  - Always serve thoughtfully.
- Thinking
```

- Testing
  1. Begin testing.
  2. Finish testing.
- Serving
  - Always serve properly.
  - Always serve thoughtfully.

## Images

Regular Markdown images are supported, and follow this format:

`![Image text](image-link.png)`

For Docusaurus, images may be stored in the `static/img/` directory.

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting. Using the the backtick character, code
can be provided as a block or inline.

Blocks require specifying the code language, and can include a block title:

```md title="welcome.md"
# Welcome!

Weclome to this markdown document!
```

```md title="welcome.md"
# Welcome

Welcome to this markdown document!
```

Inline:

````txt
This can be found in ```mysite/docs/welcome.md```.
````

This can be found in `mysite/docs/welcome.md`.

## Admonitions

Typical with knowledge base platforms, Docusaurus includes a special syntax to create admonitions
and callouts:

```md
:::tip Tip

This is a tip to help you out.

:::

:::caution Caution

Be cautious around this item.

:::

:::danger Dangerous

This action is dangerous.

:::
```

:::tip Tip

This is a tip to help you out.

:::

:::caution Caution

Be cautious around this item.

:::

:::danger Dangerous

This action is dangerous.

## MDX and React Components

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allows for interactive elements within documentation through the use of
React components:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
```

Try it for yourself!
