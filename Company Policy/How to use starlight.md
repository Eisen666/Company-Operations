# Documentation Website on Starlight

The web tool Starlight is created for creating, managing, and sharing project documentation. It
offers a simple user interface, support for Markdown, collaborative capabilities, version control,
and interfaces with other well-liked programmes.

Structured Organisation: Starlight makes it simple to organise your material by letting you build a
hierarchy of folders and documents.

Collaboration is encouraged by inviting team members to add to, update, and evaluate documentation.

Version control allows you to keep track of changes and roll back to earlier iterations as needed.

Search and Navigation: Quickly locate information and move through your paperwork with ease.

Workflows can be streamlined by integrating Starlight with your current tools.

For using Starlight ensure you have following installed. For help and further guidance you can refer
