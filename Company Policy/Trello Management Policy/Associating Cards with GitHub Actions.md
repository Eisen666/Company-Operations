# Associate Cards With GitHub Actions

When a card is moved to **Completed** on Trello, it is important that it is associated with a GitHub action. This helps someone viewing the cards to get more understanding on what was done to finalize a task. The steps to perform this action is shown below.

- Locate and open the Card on Trello

- On the right hand side of the opened card, Click on GitHub.

- Then select "**Attach Commit**" or "**Attach Branch**" depending on your scenario. In this scenario, I would attach a commit.
